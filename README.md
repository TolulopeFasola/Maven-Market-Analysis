## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis was gotten from Kaggle. The dataset consists of 7 csv files which were transformed into power query for analysis.

## Visualization and Reports

For this report, I began by creating some cards including KPI to display at the top of the report. These include Net revenue, revenue, total profit, and total orders, return quantity, return rate, Additionally, I included new measures for return quantity and net revenue as indicators to calculate the previous month’s values and used it as a goal for the current month.

The report required a visual to demonstrate profit, revenue, orders and returns as well as other indicators to give us a better understanding of the business health. A table was added with these metrics broken down by product brands, product names, profit, revenue, total orders was added into the report and gradients were implemented for greater ease of understanding. Return Quantity was set to High is Bad while the others remained in their default setting.

 Maven Market owns grocery stores in 3 different countries; the Mexico, Canada and United States. Knowing this, line chat and tree map was used for visuals, showing the number of transactions. A slicer was provided to show the data by sales region with a select multiple or select all option also added.

A drill through was also provided to product brand to select a particular product brand and interact with the dashboard. To round out the report, I decided to add other visuals for customer, gender, age, returns. These visuals are represented with pie chart, line chart with forcast for further years, gauge chart showing Maven Market’s current month’s order and previous month order.

## Conclusion

Analyzing Maven Market’s operations across the 3 countries has provided invaluable insights into the company’s performance and potential areas for improvement. Through meticulous examination, it became evident that the Canadian market was facing significant challenges with low sales, profits and alarmingly high return rates. In addition, most of the people purchasing are male and are above 75 years old. Also, there are specific products and product brands that are highly purchased across the stores. A solution is that   the two least performing stores in Canada emerged as a practical course of action to optimize resources and refocus efforts on more promising markets.
